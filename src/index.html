	<h2 id="h2">About Salmon</h2><br>
	Since salmon is the largest fish, it is commonly referred to as the atlantic fish.The salmon family of fish, particularly the pacific salmon that make up the genus Oncorhynus, are listed by a number of names. The following are the six Oncorhynchus species that are found in the Pacific: the chum or dog salmon (O. keta), which ranges from the Mackenzie and Lena rivers in the southern Arctic southward to Japan and the Rogue River; the king, spring, or chinook salmon (O. tshawytscha), which ranges from the Yukon River to China; and the sockeye or red salmon (O. nerka), which ranges from the northern Bering Sea to Japan and the Columbia River of the American Northwest. and the Sacramento River; the cherry salmon (O. masu), which is found off the coast of Japan; and the pink or humpback salmon (O. gorbuscha), which is found from the Arctic to Japan and the Klamath River. The rivers that border the North Atlantic on both sides are home to the Atlantic salmon.<br>
	<h3>How many species of Salmon are there?</h3>
	<p>There are six species of Salmon.FIve of them are found in North America:<b>chinook, coho, chum, sockeye,</b> and <b>pink </b> . And one of them are only found in Asian water:<b> Masu Salmon</b>.</p><br>
	<div><div id="chinook"><img src="chinook img.jpeg" style="width: 150px; height: 100px;" ><br><br></div></div>
	<b>Chinook</b> is also called king Fish as it is the largest Pacific Salmon species and it can grow between three feet (0.9 meters) and five feet (1.5 meters) long and its weight is approximately in between 30 pounds (13 kilograms) and 110 pounds (50 kilograms). The Chinook Salmon can be identified from their colour as their head and back are of blue-green and silver on the sides. Moreover, their tail, back, and upper fin have irregular black spots.<br><br><br><br><br><br>

	<div><div id=coho><img src="coho new img.jpeg" style="width: 150px; height: 100px;" ></div></div>
	<b>Coho, (Oncorhynchus kisutch)</b>, salmon species, family Salmonidae, prized for food and sport. Their weight can be more than 16kg (35 pounds) and can be recoganized by samll spots on the back and upper tail-fin lobe. Young coho needs to stay in fresh water for one year then enter onto the North Pacific waters where they get matured matured in three years. Some of the Coho Salmon called landlocked since they spend their whole life in fresh water. <br><br><br><br><br><br>

	<div><div id="chum"><img src="chum.jpg" style="width: 150px; height: 100px;" ></div></div>
	<b>chum Salmon</b> also known as Oncorhynchus keta, calico Salmon and Dog Salmon. This is a lightly speckled North Pacific fish, family Salmonidae, and their weight can be up to 15 kilograms that means 33 pounds. This fish can grow between the length of 35 to 45 inches long. They can be reoganized from small speckles on their back and white mouth with a white gum line and dark tongue. Males have reddish-purple markings while females are less colourful.   <br><br><br><br><br><br>
	<div><div id="sockeye"><img src="sokeye.jpg" style="width: 150px; height: 100px;" ></div></div>
	<b>Sockeye salmon, (Oncorhynchus nerka)</b>, family Salmonidae that lacks distinct spots oon the body. Their weight can be 4 to 15 pounds and are usually 1.5 to 2.5 feet in length. Their bodies become silver or blue in salty water. These can be identified from golden eyes that are much bigger than other species of salmon. These salmon don't have any spot on their body but have white gums and a white interior of the mouth.  <br><br><br><br><br><br>

	<div><div id="pink"><img src="pink.jpg" style="width: 150px; height: 100px;" ></div></div>
	<b>Pink salmon, (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha)</b>, North Pacific food fish, fammily Salmonidae. It is the smallest on the Pacific salmon and their weight can be approximately 2 kilograms (4 1/2 pounds) and 20 to 25 inches long and can be identified from large markings and irregular spots. These often spawns on tidal flats. Unlike Coho, these immediately enter the sea after hatching. Their alternative name is humpback refers to the hump that develops on the back of males. <br><br><br><br><br><br>

	<div><div id="masu"><img src="masu.jpg" style="width: 150px; height: 100px;" ></div></div>
	<b>Masu (Oncorhynchus Masou)</b>, found only in Asian pasific. Like Pink salmon, it is the smallest Pacific Salmon. Their length can be up to 20 inches(50 cm) and average weight in 4 to 5.5 pounds(2-2.5 kg). Like Coho, these stay in fresh water for 1-3 winters. These just spend their one year in salt water and spend most of the time in either the Sea of Japan or the Sea of Okhotsk. These have a darkened back and the stripes on the sides.<br><br><br><br><br><br>

<section class="predators-section" id="predators">
	<h2 id="h2">Prey & Predators</h2><br>
	Salmon are indigenous to North America's Pacific Northwest, where they are essential to the environment. But over thousands of years, a number of predators that have co-evolved with salmon now live in this area. Let's examine a few of these dangerous predators in more detail: Bears are well-known salmon predators, especially grizzly and black bears. Bears congregate around rivers and streams during the salmon spawning season to gorge on these nutrient-dense fish. They use a variety of strategies to capture their prey, such as sitting patiently next to waterfalls or snatching fish straight out of the water with their strong paws. Salmon is a major food source for raptors like ospreys and bald eagles, who are adept hunters. With their keen senses and powerful claws, these magnificent animals can detect and seize salmon from rivers, or they can plunge into the water with their feet first to catch them.

	<h2 id="h2">World Count Of Salmons</h2><br>
	Total global salmon population is approximately in between 288 and 674 million fish. If talk about how many of salmons survive in the world then the ratio would be 2% of all salmon hatched the live to adulthood. Being the food fish, Salmon are intensively farmed in many parts of theworld, with Norway being the world's largest producer of farmed salmon. Most of the Salmon species live in Pacific ocean including Chinook, Chum, Coho, Pink and Sockeye.<br>
